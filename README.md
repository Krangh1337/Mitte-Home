This project aims for rewriting the NFC-tags used in the filter cartridges of the "Mitte Home" 3-in-1 watersystem.

**Why**
The company went bankrupt without informing customers.
- App is bricked: You can no longer see the remaining bottle fills of the cartridge and the CO2-bottle
- You can no longer order new cartridges, which renders the whole device useless once the cartridge is seen as empty by the device.
